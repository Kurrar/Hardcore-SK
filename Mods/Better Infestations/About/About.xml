	<description>This mod changes almost everything about infestations, the way they produce and insect behavior.

UPDATE FOR RIMWORLD 1.0

    * The mod has been completely overhauled, less harmony reliance
    * Added insect Queens that produce eggs and manages the hive
    * Hive ecosystems. Eggs require insect jelly to breed new insects, bugs gather resources to convert to jelly
    * More insect factions! Watch them fight eachother for map control
    * Smarter insect AI. They hunt, they gather, they harvest, they will even breach your walls to get to your food
    * New infestation incident. If you let their population get out of control they will tunnel to your food stocks
    * All settings now changeable in the mod settings menu, control how difficult you want them to be
    * English language translation file included, if you create one for a different language let me know so I can upload it

    Thanks for being patient, I know some of you waited awhile for this update to get done. Have fun!

COMPATIBILITY

    This mod will patch add thingclass to all the vanilla bugs. Other mods such as Animal Variety Coats do this too, make sure Better Infestations loads after them.

    If adding this mod into a current save, you must get the mod Faction Discovery to load the new insect factions that come with this mod.
